## ⭐ Inspiration

I've always been interested in the making of video games, and even got my start programming by building simple games. In order to learn python, I decided to do a mini-project that would introduce me to various modules. I decided to remake the popular dino game on chrome that shows up when you go offline.
I was also learning about some basic AI concepts at school and I wanted to apply that to this project so I then modified the game to include a neural network that would learn to play the game by itself.

## 🚀 What it Does

My version of the Chrome Dino Game is nearly identical to the original, with an accurate physics model, infinite scroll, and a saved high score. I then
modified it with a neural network that learns to play the game over time and consistently got better.

## 💎 How I built it

- Python's PyGame and Math model
- Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies(NEAT) neural network for training

## 🤘 Challenges I ran into

- This was one of my first exposures to python so I had to learn the language and the modules that came along with it
- I had to learn about Neural Networks and how they worked
- Had to understand the NEAT pattern
- I had to play around with various labels in the network to get an ideal, "smart" model

## 🏆 Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- This project was one of my favorites because I genuinely enjoyed 
everything that I was learning about. I got a little insight into the complexities of a player model in video games with things such as boundaries,
collision detection, and physics.
- I also enjoyed learning about neural networks and the science and math behind them.
